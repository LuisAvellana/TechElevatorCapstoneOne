# 1st Capstone Project at Tech Elevator

In this project I pair programmed with a partner to create an application that allowed customer's to link with their accounts and order catering products from their computer.

The application reads a ```.csv``` file inputted by the user. The user is then allowed to view stock on all items and make orders. Upon doing so they are given a reciept and change for their order. 

All actions are audited and recorded on a log file. This includes adding money to an account, itemizing purchases, and change given.

This work was done after 4 weeks of class lectures.
